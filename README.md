<h1>The repository contains 3 projects</h1>
<h1>Project 1. Extracting Stock Data Using a Web Scraping</h1>
 Not all stock data is available via API in this project; Use web-scraping to obtain financial data.
 Using beautiful soup I extracted historical share data from a web-page.

<h1>Project 2. Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library</h1>
A company's stock share is a piece of the company more precisely:
A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." 
An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases,the investor with incur a loss.  Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day the stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges.
I assumed the role of a data scientist working for a hedge fund; it's my job to determine any suspicious stock activity. In this project I extracted stock data using a Python library. I used the yfinance library, it allows users to extract data for stocks returning data in a pandas dataframe.

<h1>Project 3. Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data</h1>
Description
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this project, I extracted some stock data, and displayed the data in a graph.
